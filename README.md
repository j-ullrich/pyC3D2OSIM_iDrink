# Notes for DART-Lab members
I forked the code from https://github.com/dvarnai/pyC3D2OSIM. I added a function to Batch-Process a folder that either contains c3d files or that contains sub-folder that contain c3d-files.
At the moment (05.08.2024) it only works with files generated by Qualisys. The changes needed to extend compatibility should be easy to add.

For batch processing you can use the path to the folder as string as input. It iterates thorugh all subfolders and c3d Files:
`--root_folder=[pathtofolder]`

No what follows is the README from the original Repository when forked.

# pyC3D2OSIM 

Using this library you can extract and transform markers from C3D files into the OpenSim format and co-ordinate system

# Installation

Just check out this repository and run

`pip install .`

# Usage

To just extract the markers from a C3D/TRC file, you can run the script as follows:

`python extractMarkers.py input.c3d --output-file=output.trc`

You can also extract and/or rename specific markers using the --markers parameters:

`--markers m1 m2 m3=renamedM3 m4=renamedM4`

To translate all markers relative to another marker:

`--origin_marker m1`

To rotate the co-ordinate system around axes defined by markers you can use the --axes_markers parameter.
The first argument is the letter of the axes you want to rotate around followed by a pair of marker names:

`--axes_markers xy x1 x2 y1 y2`

You can also provide the .osim model file to automatically match the markers for rotation:

`--osim_model model.osim`

To translate between motion capture and OpenSim co-ordinate systems, you can use the --mocap_transform parameter.
For known systems (currently only Qualisys), you can put the following:

`--mocap_transform qualisys`

To define your own translation, put the axes in the order you want them to be swapped as the first parameter followed
by the rotation around each axes in degrees:

`--mocap_transform yxz 90 180 0`

For batch processing you can use the path to the folder as string as input. It iterates thorugh all subfolders and c3d Files:
`--root_folder=[pathtofolder]`

You can also use this library as an imported module in your scripts.
